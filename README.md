Improved Blizzard UI (Classic Edition)
====================

Improved Blizzard UI is an attempt to improve the World of Warcraft interface by styling frames, implementing additional functionality and restructuring / hiding existing elements.

Due to the drastic differences between Classic and Mainline WoW this has been forked to it's own thing.

This is a complete ground up rewrite using Ace3 to make porting between versions a bit easier and the upgrade process between patches smoother.
